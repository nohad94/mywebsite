                Coming to Canada as an international student, I was priveleged to experience a wide range of different cultures which have instilled within me a kind of respect, admiration and understanding for the differences that many do not get to experience. <br>
                My passion for the history of ancient civilizations has grown thanks to every experience I have had with people from different cultures. <br>
                As a military historian it is incredibly interesting for me to see how different civilization have dealt with the idea of war and I believe that I have been able to study a wide variety of cultures as well as a wide variety of warfare. <br>
                Within Europe, I have learnt how competition and continuing warfare have prepelled advancement of war time tactics as well as war technology. While in dynastic China, the very little presence of advanced tribes and people, in the ways of war, had caused the Chinese advancement in war technology and strategy to stagnate.
